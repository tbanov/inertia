## What's this mean?

-   All my projects have taught me that **web.php** is an ugly place to be.

    We could do;

    -   Auth.php - Auth::routes()
    -   And Dem` other categories as we see fit.

    Just Saying tho`

-   I might be the only one who gets this, so let's say it's a personal reminder.

    ```
    [$positive, $response] = $this->ModelService->index();

    return backward($positive?'success':'error',$reponse);
    ```
